INTRO TO WEB DEVELOPEMENT

For this assignment I will recap the "intro to web development" video assigned. To start we will differentiate UI/UX and what a fullstack is. UI is user interface, this is primarily what the end users see and physical interaction. UX is the user experience, these individuals pull data from servers and are primarily responsible for getting data from databases, functionality, and the logic behind web applications . As explained in the video if UI is the dining room or waiter, then UX is the kitchen staff. Now a fullstack is an individual that has knowledge in both UI and UX. These individuals are highly skilled and are well rounded. As for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, a good example is seeing it as a structure. HTML is primarily responsible for the text you see on a webpage, and then CSS is the visuals you see, and lastly JavaScript is the functionality of a webpage.
